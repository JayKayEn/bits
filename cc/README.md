Bits (C++)
==========

## TODO

+ Port test suite from C
+ Design a `uint256_t` class and add support for it. (The design should be easily extensible to 512-bits and beyond).

## Usage

The library is in `cc/bits.hh`, a single-include header file. The `cc/inc/` directory files are necessary for compilation.

## N-bit Support

Coming soon.

### Extending

Coming soon.

## Testing

Coming soon.
