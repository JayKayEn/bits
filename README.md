Bits
====

## About

Bits is a bit permutation/manipulation library implemented in both C and C++.

## Usage

The separate language implementations and documentation are in their respective folders (i.e. C in `c/`, C++ in `cc/`).

## Notes

### Makefiles

This project is still under active development. As such, the Makefiles have been configured for my system. You may need to modify them for your own.

### Credit

Much of this code is inspired by the code, pseudocode, and research of others. A _very_ short list of those who's work I am grateful for is below. This list will be expanded as the project nears completion.
